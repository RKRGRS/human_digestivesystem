<body>
<p>The digestive system of the human body comprises a group of organs working together to convert food into energy for the <p>
<p>body. Anatomically, the digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract, along with the accessory organs <p>
<p>such as the liver, pancreas and gall bladder. The hollow organs that make up the gastrointestinal tract include the<p>
 <p>mouth, stomach, oesophagus, small intestine and large intestine that contains the rectum and the anus. The alimentary canal <p>
 <p>is a long tube through which the food that we eat is passed . It begins at the mouth (buccal or oral cavity)  <p>
 <p>, passes through the pharynx , oesophagus or food pipe , stomach , small intestine , large intestines ,  rectum <p>
 <p>and finally ends at the anus. The food particles gradually get digested  as they travel through various compartments of the <p>
 <p>alimentary canal. Accessory organs are organs which participate in the digestion process but are not actually a <p>
<p> part of GIT. They stimulate the digestion by releasing certain enzymes that help in breaking down the food.<p>
<p>PARTS AND FUNTIONS OF THE HUMAN DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.<p>
<p><font color="green">Gastrointestinal tract:-<p></font>
<p><font color="green">Mouth<p></font>
<p>Food starts its journey from the mouth or the oral cavity. There are many other organs that contribute to the digestion process,<p>
 <p>including teeth , salivary glands and tongue. Teeth are designed for grinding food particles into small pieces and<p>
<p> are moistened with saliva before the tongue pushes the food into the pharynx.<p> 
<p><font color="green">Pharynx<p></font>
<p>A fibro-muscular  y-shaped tube attached to the terminal end of the mouth . It is mainly involved in the passage of<p>
 <p>chewed | crushed food from the mouth through the oesophagus. It also has a major part in the respiratory system ,<p>
 <p>as air travels through the pharynx from the nasal cavity on its way to the lungs.<p>
<p><font color="green">Oesophagus<p></font>
<p>This is a muscular tube that connects the pharynx , which is a part of an upper sectionof the gastrointestinal tract . <p>
<p>It supplies swallowed food along with its length.<p>
<p><font color="green">Stomach<p></font>
<p>It serves as a muscular bag which is situated towards the left side of the abdominal cavity, beneath the diaphragm.<p>
 <p>The vital organs acts as a storage for the food and provides enough time to digest meals. The stomach also produces  
 <p>digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid that maintains the process of digestion.
<p><font color="green">Small intestine<p></font>
<p>The small intestine is a thin, long tube of about 10 feet long and a part of the lower gastrointestinal tract. It is<p>
 <p>present behind the stomach and acquires a maximum area of the abdominal cavity. The complete small intestine is coiled<p>
 <p>and the inner surface consists of folds and ridges.<p>
<p><font color="green">>Large intestine<p></font>
<p>This is a thick, long tube measuring around 5 feet in length. It is present just beneath the stomach and wraps over<p>
<p> the superior and lateral edges of the small intestine. It absorbs water and consists of the bacteria(symbiotic) that<p>
 <p>support the breakdown of wastes to fetch small nutrients.<p>
<p><font color="green">Rectum<p></font>
<p>The rectum is the part of the large intestine that connects the colon to the anus. It is the area where stools <p>
<p>(semi-solid undigested matters ) are hold before exiting it from the body.<p>
<p><font color="green">Anus<p></font>
<p>The anus is the end part of large intestine and removed faeces (undigested matters) from the body.<p>
<p><font color="green">Accessory organs :-<p></font>
<p><font color="green">Pancreas <p></font>
<p>Pancreas is the gland ,which secretes pancreatic juice which digest starch(carbohydrates), proteins and breaks down<p>
<p>the emulsified fats. It  also secretes insulin hormones.<p>
<p><font color="green">Liver<p></font>
<p>Liver is the biggest gland of the human body, which secretes bile that play a role in digesting fat and some vitamins.<p>
<p><font color="green">Gall bladder<p></font>
<p>Bile is stored in a saclike structure called the gall bladder.<p>
